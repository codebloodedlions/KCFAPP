Langston University Team: ”Code Blooded” -   HELP (Humanitarian Emergency Liberation Platform) 
Our app solves the issue of refugees not having easily accessed location data on places that could aid them. Donors will be able to input what services they provide, their organization’s name and address.  The donor’s information will then be stored in our database to be viewed later by people using the refugee section of our app. The app was created using Java, Database, SQLite, MySQL, Android Studio, Php, Microsoft Video Editor, and Html.
